While many people have access to the internet, mobile app devs are working tremendously to push out updates for their apps to make it perfect for the consumers.

“Mobile apps ease the life of the customers by offering them one-touch access and a simple purchasing process” \cite{hilliard2014}. Not only that they can use apps on their smart devices to play games or read news or chat with their friends, they can even use their smart devices to make payment when going to the market or any other stores, they have a specific app for storing consumers credit cards and debit cards so they do not have to carry their physical cards around risking losing it.
