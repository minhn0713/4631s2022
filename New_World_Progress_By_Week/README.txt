_Since we are developing an app that was created in the last semester, we will use the design that we created last year, and we did add some design for chat features this semester as well. We used Figma to design the user interface.
(The link to Figma is https://www.figma.com/file/cONnOACWt4jMn0u1Q2zuOu/Proposal-AppLayout?node-id=0%3A1) 
We have 6 main layouts and many different small layouts for each main layouts. We will add more layouts here as our project proceeds. 
_Intro Screen: This will be the introduction for our app 
_Signing Screen: This is the screen where users can log in using their registered email and password or they can login using their Facebook / Google accounts. 
_Signup Screen: This is the screen where users can sign up for the account so they can log in. _Homepage Screen: This is the screen where we will display the news to our users, we have a hot news display on the very top and all other news below hot news. Also we have different news categories that they can choose, we will filter based on user's preferences. 
_Chatting screen: This is the screen where users can chat with their friends. 
_Settings screen: This is the screen where users can change the app's layout based on their liking. We have dark/light themes for them to choose. We have accounts settings where users can edit their profiles/change password/privacy & security. We have text size where users can change the text font size either small/medium/big. Lastly, we have terms of service for our app and app feedback where users can submit any problems related to the app.
